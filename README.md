## D12-7/25/2020
Attended SPAIC ML Kick-off meeting and reviewing Lesson 2

## D13-7/26/2020
Studied the ML key ideas recommended and made by @carlosalcantara - Thank you!!
ML Lesson 2 key points
What is machine learning?
How is machine learning different from traditional programming?
History of machine learning
The 6 steps in the data science process
The 4 main data types
Scaling data: standardization vs normalization
Encoding categorical data: one-hot vs ordinal
Understanding how image data gets represented as numbers
Understanding how text data gets represented as numbers
Statistical vs computer science vocabulary (two words for the same concept)
Models vs Algorithms
Linear regression (what is it? How does it work?)
What is a learning function
Parametric vs non-parametric
Classical ML vs deep learning
Understand that there are 3 types of learning (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement)
Bias vs variance
Overfitting vs underfitting
For these topics, I would make sure to be aware that they exist but you don’t need to worry about them too much as they will be more clear once you begin using them in the future
Common libraries for ML (understand that they exist but don’t need to memorize these)
Cloud Services
